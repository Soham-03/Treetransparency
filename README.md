![Tree Transparency Logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/example/logo.png)

## Overview

_Tree Transparency_ is a blockchain-enabled platform designed to improve transparency and efficiency in tree plantation initiatives by NGOs and government bodies. Developed by a dedicated team as part of the Bachelor of Engineering degree requirements at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, Mumbai, this system leverages cutting-edge technology including blockchain and IoT to ensure every tree's growth is tracked and funds are utilized properly.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Ensures transparency and traceability of funds and tree growth records.
- **Volunteer Tracking System:** Engages local communities by allowing volunteers to monitor tree growth, which is incentivized through a reward system.
- **IoT Growth Tracking:** Utilizes IoT devices for real-time monitoring of tree growth in areas less accessible to volunteers.
- **Geolocation Features:** All trees are geotagged, allowing for precise location and monitoring of each planted tree.
- **Data-Driven Tree Selection:** Analyzes environmental data to recommend the best tree species for specific locations, optimizing survival rates and environmental impact.

## Usage

After launching the app, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the platform. Register as a new user to start tracking tree growth or making donations.
