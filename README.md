##Tree Transparency
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Tree Transparency project. This system, developed as part of our Bachelor of Engineering degree at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, is designed to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of tree plantation initiatives through blockchain technology and a sophisticated tree monitoring system.

Project Overview
Tree Transparency aims to address critical challenges in environmental conservation efforts such as deforestation and climate change. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency in fund transfers and tree plantations conducted by NGOs and government bodies. Additionally, it features a volunteer-based tracking system for monitoring the growth of planted trees.

Key Features
Blockchain Deployment: Ensures transparency and security in financial transactions and tree adoption processes.
Volunteer Tracking System: Empowers local citizens to monitor tree growth and health, contributing to the system's accuracy and community engagement.
Automated Growth Tracking: Utilizes IoT devices to automatically measure tree growth in areas less accessible to volunteers.
Data Analytics: Leverages advanced analytics to recommend the most suitable tree species for specific locations based on environmental data.
