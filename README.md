## Overview

_Tree Transparency_ is a blockchain-enabled platform designed to improve transparency and efficiency in tree plantation initiatives by NGOs and government bodies. Developed by a dedicated team as part of the Bachelor of Engineering degree requirements at Fr.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Ensures transparency and traceability of funds and tree growth records.
- **Volunteer Tracking System:** Engages local communities by allowing volunteers to monitor tree growth, which is incentivized through a reward system.
- **IoT Growth Tracking:** Utilizes IoT devices for real-time monitoring of tree growth in areas less accessible to volunteers.
